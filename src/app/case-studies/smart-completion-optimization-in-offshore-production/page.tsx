					Deepwater offshore oil production faces significant challenges,
					including managing production in multiple zones of the reservoir, the
					need to maximize the recovery factor and reducing costly
					interventions. In this context, the adoption of intelligent
					completions integrated with advanced flow estimation software by zone
					has stood out as an effective solution for optimizing production and
					reducing operating costs. <br />
					<br />
					Smart completions are equipped with flow control valves and sensors
					distributed throughout the well, allowing continuous monitoring of
					reservoir conditions. However, accurately interpreting the data
					collected requires advanced analytical tools. Specialized software,
					using numerical modeling and machine learning, makes it possible to
					estimate the individual flow of each producing zone and adjust
					production control in real time, increasing operational efficiency.{' '}
					<br />
					<br />
					The implementation of this technology makes it possible to optimize
					flow distribution throughout the well, minimizing problems such as
					water and gas conification. As a result, there is a significant
					improvement in the efficiency of draining the reservoir, reducing the
					need for mechanical interventions and extending the useful life of the
					wells. In addition, the ability to predict and mitigate problems
					before they compromise production contributes to the sustainability
					and profitability of the operation. <br />
					<br />
					Another important benefit is improved decision-making, since the
					detailed visualization of flows by zone allows dynamic adjustments to
					the production strategy. Operators can prioritize more productive
					zones and close others that present a high risk of unwanted
					production, resulting in a better economic balance for the enterprise
					and maximizing the return on investment. <br />
					<br />
					Case studies indicate that companies results such as increasing
					productivity by more than 20% and reducing water injection by 60% by
					injector wells have already been observed in pilot studies conducted
					around the world, due to a robust forecast of flow rates by zone that
					has allowed better decisions to be made about valve configuration in
					order to slow down the advance of water from injector wells and
					increase recovery in oil-rich zones. Using the Buzios Field as an
					example, financial impacts of optimized intelligent completions
					estimate up to 70M USD per year. <br />
					<br />
					In reservoirs with a high gas-oil ratio, the solution can also be
					particularly beneficial. Better valve control results in production
					with a higher concentration of oil by allowing more precise control of
					gas advance, which causes increases of up to 40% in oil production
					that can result in millions of barrels in a few years. <br />
					<br />
					The improved management of intelligent completions, supported by
					specialized software, represents a strategic evolution for deepwater
					offshore production. The ability to estimate flow by zone and
					dynamically adjust the operation not only maximizes production
					efficiency, but also promotes more sustainable and economically viable
					exploitation of oil reservoirs in complex environments, as
					demonstrated in technical literature and real industry applications.
